# Linear Regression

## This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. 
The goal is to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## WorkFlow of Linear Regression model

- Step 1 : Set Learning Rate and Number of Iterations; Initiate Random weight and bias Value.
- Step 2 : Build Linear Regression Equation. ( y = wX + b )
- Step 3 : Find the "y pred" value for given x value for the corresponding weight and bias.
- Step 4 : Check the Loss Funcion for these parameter values. (difference between "y pred" and "true value")
- Step 5 : Update the parameter values using Gradient Descent. ( new weight and bias value )
- Step 6 : Step 3, 4, 5 are repeated till we get minimum loss function.

Finally we will get the best model ( best weight and bias value ) as it has minimum loss function.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the process of building a linear regression model from scratch using Python. 
The implementation of gradient descent for optimizing the model parameters showcases the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
